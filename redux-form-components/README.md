Example of implementing form components backed by [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form), extracted from an application which uses [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) for layout and [react-widgets](https://github.com/jquense/react-widgets)' date picker, where all the forms redux-form is being used to manage happen to have 2 column layouts.
